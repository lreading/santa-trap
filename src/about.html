                <h3>The Beginning</h3>
                <p>
                    Our family's Santa Trap Tradition began the year my brother jokingly sang 
                    <em>“Kidnap the Sandy Claws”</em> from <strong>The Nightmare Before Christmas</strong> 
                    to his daughter. Outraged, she smacked him and declared that Santa was far too 
                    smart to ever be kidnapped. Naturally, I took this as a personal challenge.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That December, armed with a cooler, a net, some cardboard signs, and a questionable 
                    amount of confidence, I built the first official <strong>Santa Trap</strong>. 
                    Christmas morning  revealed a closed cooler, a teasing Santa hat poking out, 
                    and a stocking full of coal, along with a note from Santa himself, roasting our efforts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And thus a tradition was born.

                <h3>The Escalation</h3>
                <p>
                    What started as a silly one-off joke quickly transformed into a yearly arms race 
                    between us and the world's jolliest escape artist. Each Christmas Eve, we design 
                    and deploy a brand-new trap: each more elaborate, ridiculous, and wildly over-engineered 
                    than the last.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We've used nets, bait, pulleys, improvised tripwires, and even some
                    high-tech Raspberry Pi contraptions. Santa continues to outsmart us with ease. 
                    Some years he leaves notes. Some years he leaves evidence of just how close (or 
                    far) we were. But he always escapes.

                <p>
                    This site is our record of the ongoing saga: a chronicle of every trap, every 
                    failure, every close call, and every snarky response from Santa. Each post shares 
                    the design, the execution, the results, and the inevitable lessons learned.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whether you're here for inspiration, entertainment, or to reassure yourself that 
                    your own family traditions are perfectly normal by comparison, we're glad you found us.
